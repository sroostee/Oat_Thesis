Presentation outline

############# Week 6-10 January	##############

Taking a batch from the loaded data and conversion from 4D to 5D structure managed for images. 
	- not yet for labels 
	- not matched 
Creating layers with a 3D convolutions in using fastai support works (conv3D_NotebookTest)
Also possible to add this layer into a UnetBlock making it a 3D Unet block
Figuring out where to go from there, build 3D mini Unet? 
Accessing final layer(s) of dynamic Unet appears hard because of the dynamic way it has been built up (using e.g. resnet structure. Current idea to take the output of the completed dynamic Unet (resnet structure) and put that into a small 3D UNnet.

############# Week 18 November - 20 December	##############

Worked on Dataloading in a custom manner for in-batch sorting, while random batch orders to save 3D info within batches. 
Structured project across both devices through Git. 
Working on understanding and applying a 3D conv layer from PyTorch 
Converting two 2D conv layers to 1 3D conv layer. 
Figuring out how 

############# Week 11-15 November	##############

Indepth learning of algorithm structures:
	kaimining initialisation
	normalisation
Start on own 3D CNN with Pytorch

#############	Week 4-8 November 	##############

Image Analysis course
More indepth learning of the CNN/Resnet/Unet structrue:
	matmul, broadcasting, einstein summation
	convolutions, forward and backward pass
NLP lecture series day

#############	Week 28-1 October/November	############

Testing 2D classification with first set of rotated images both in training and validation sets. Small set, 4 epochs overall accuracy 0.968. Per class:
label 	score
0.0 	0.991383
1.0 	0.942063
2.0 	0.832028
3.0 	0.742473
*note: aleurone is wider in BM3 training set which results in slightly too wide predicted aleurone in BM1 validation set. 
**note2: initialising appears slower than actual training

Full data set (all rotated images)
label 	score
0.0 	0.989370
1.0 	0.938894
2.0 	0.831126
3.0 	0.758193


#############	Week 21-25 October	#############

Watching lectures on programming a NN from scratch (lecture 8)
	Covered topics: - Frobenius norm
					- Broadcasting
					- Einstein summation (einsum)
					- Direct pytorch operations (e.g. matmul)

Testing the 2D classification with first sets of rotated images.
	BM1 as validation set, BM3 as training set. Images rotated with z 90' and x 90'. Even when keeping rotated images out of the training set the first results were promising (all classed above 60% accuracy with 4 epochs on 128x128 images).
