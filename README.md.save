# Oat_Thesis

Project overview:






Author: Suze Julia Roostee
Supervised by: Nikos Tsardakas Renhuldt, Nick Sirijovski

---------

Software versions:

The project was carried out on Ubuntu 18.04.4 with Linux kernel (4.15.0-76) 
and on 

Commandline environment:
- ImageMagick 6.9.7-4

(Fiji is just) ImageJ version 2.0.0

Python packages were installed through conda environment and run in Jupyter Notebook. The fastai/pytorch environment was set up like:

conda install -c pytorch -c fastai fastai
conda install jupyter notebook
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions 

conda create $fastai2020 
conda activate $fastai2020

The full environemnt can be set up with the environmentfile environment.yml like:
conda env create -f environment.yml

---------

Data preprocessing

Coversion of coloured labels to label values and storing the new labels in NewLabels directory
run as ./create_new_labels_with_fuzz_oat.zsh

Rotate the image stacks and the labels with the 

TransformJ Turn
TransformJ Rotate

Suggested structure:
Oat/
	Oat_variety/ #various seeds
		Images Labels NewLabels
---------

Data loading

Before moving to the script make sure you have the following file structure for training:

	train/
		Images NewLabels valid.txt

All images and labels required to training should be linked or copied to their respective directories. 
Labels should have the same file name as their corresponding image.
Images used for validation during trainging should be specified in valid.txt 
e.g.
ln -s ~/seed_images/Data_for_ML_Test/Oat/Om2/Images/* .
ls Omat*.tif > valid.txt
cd ..
mv Images/valid.txt .

---------

Training classifier

Training and evaluation of the classifier is carried in Jupyter Notebook with the files 2D_segmentation.ipynb or 3D_segmentation.ipynb


---------
Predictions

After training directory will look like
mogrify -crop sizexsize+0+0 *.tif


train/
	Images  Labels  models  valid.txt predict_oat.pkl

To run predictions only the predict_oat.pkl is required

---------
Volume calculations
